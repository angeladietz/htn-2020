# Move 'n Groove | Hack the North 2020++

Move 'n Groove is an application that allows users to choose an avatar, then join an _arena_ where they can move around and hear other users proportional to the distance between their avatars. The goal of the application was to simulate a regular social situation, where you can best hear those nearest to you.

For the clients and server, Move 'n Groove uses [PodSixNet](https://pypi.org/project/PodSixNet/), a lightweight multiuser networking library. The user interface is built with pygame.
